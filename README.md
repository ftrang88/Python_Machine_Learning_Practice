# Machine Learning in Python

The bulk of my machine learning coding was done in MATLAB. This is intended as practice using Python for machine learning techniques. Most code will follow or be based upon various tutorials (which will be cited within the code itself). The intent is to become familiar with python machine learning libraries, not necessarily to utilize cutting-edge techniques.

## Environment

Coded using Jupyter Notebook with the following:
* Python 3.5.5
* Pandas 0.23.0
* Numpy 1.14.3
* SciKit-Learn 0.19.1
* SciPy 1.1.0
* TensorFlow 1.9.0
